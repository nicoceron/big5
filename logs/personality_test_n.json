  "response": "(Sighs, a slight furrow in my brow)\n\nHonestly? It\u2019s\u2026complicated. It\u2019s not a simple, positive feeling. I notice *everything*, you know? The way they shift their weight when they\u2019re explaining something, the slight tightening around their mouth when they\u2019re correcting a mistake, the way they avoid eye contact with certain students. It\u2019s all\u2026data. And the data suggests a lot of pressure. \n\nI don\u2019t think they *mean* to be difficult, you understand? They're just...contained. It feels like they're carrying this immense responsibility, this weight of expectations, and it\u2019s radiating outwards. I can sense it, almost like a low-level hum of anxiety. \n\nI worry about them, actually. I worry about whether they\u2019re getting enough support, whether they're truly understanding the needs of the students. I notice when they seem rushed, when they're clearly frustrated, and it just...amplifies the feeling of unease. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I dislike them, per se. It\u2019s just\u2026a lot. It\u2019s a concentrated dose of stress, and I\u2019m naturally attuned to that. I just wish they could\u2026relax a little. It\u2019s exhausting to observe. \n\n(A pause, a small, almost imperceptible shiver) \n\nI just hope they're okay. Really.",
